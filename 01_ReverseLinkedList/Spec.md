# `01: Reverse A Linked List`

## Objective
Write a function that reverses a singly linked list. The function should modify the list in place and return the new head of the reversed list.

## Input

The input will be the head of a singly linked list. Each node in the linked list contains an integer value and a pointer to the next node.
The list can be of any length, including 0 (empty list).

## Output 

The output should be the new head of the list after reversal. If the list is empty, return null or the equivalent in your programming language.

## Bonus Restrictions
These are optional but the more you stack, the more points you get. +1 per restriction, no matter what it is.

- [X] Reverse the list in place - no additional lists, temp variables allowed
- [X] Strongly typed
- [ ] Calculate Time Complexity
- [ ] Add atleast 3 tests
