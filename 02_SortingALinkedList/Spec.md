# `01: Sorting A Linked List`

## Objective  

Write a function that sorts a singly linked list

## Input

The input will be the head of a singly linked list  
Each node in the linked list contains an integer value and a pointer to the next node  
The list can be of any length, including 0  

## Output 

The output should be the new head of the list after sorting.  
If the list is empty, `return null`
When traversed, the value of each node should be in either ascending or descending order

## Bonus Restrictions
These are optional but the more you stack, the more points you get. +1 per restriction, no matter what it is.

- [ ] Use Recursion
- [ ] Implement multiple sorting algorithms
    ```python
    for algorithm in implementation : points = points + 1
    ``` 
- [ ] Provide benchmark timings
- [ ] Add atleast 3 tests
